# The MCU low fuse word needs to be set to 0x72: 8 MHz internal oscillator, divide clock by 8. At startup this gives 
# a 1 MHz clock. We start the MCU at this low speed because when the board is first powered up,
# the MCU only gets 2.5 volts, and cannot run at full speed. Once the firmware starts running,
# it will enable full power, and then turn off the divide by 8, giving a full 8 MHz clock. 
# bootloader.low_fuses=0x72

# The following line should go into C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\arduino\avr\programmers.txt
# Because the MCU only runs at 1 MHz when it starts up, the uploader needs slow down a bit to be able to talk to the MCU.
